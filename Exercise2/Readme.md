### Exercise 2

Task: Research online for 10 more linux commands aside the ones already mentioned in this module. Submit using your altschool-cloud-exercises project, explaining what each command is used for with examples of how to use each and example screenshots of using each of them.

### LINUX COMMANDS
Linux provides a powerful command-line interface compared to other operating systems such as Windows and MacOS. A lot of basic work and advanced work can be carried out through the terminal. We can do some basic tasks such as creating a file, deleting a file, moving a file, and more. In addition, we can also perform advanced tasks such as administrative tasks (including package installation, user management), networking tasks (ssh connection), security tasks, and many more.
For the sake of this exercise, we will be looking at commands that have not been used at this of the course.

1. wc
   
wc stands for word count. As the name implies, it is mainly used for counting purpose.

It is used to find out number of lines, word count, byte and characters count in the files specified in the file arguments.
By default it displays four-columnar output.
First column shows number of lines present in a file specified, second column shows number of words present in the file, third column shows number of characters present in file and fourth column itself is the file name which are given as argument.

Syntax:

```
wc [OPTION]... [FILE]...
```

Example 

```find -name "execute"```
